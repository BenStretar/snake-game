

I created this project over winter break in preparation for my solo project.

I wanted to get a understanding of setting up a game area and how to set up moving around using the arrow keys on a keyboard.

https://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/javascript-keycodes/ - this site helped me better understand moving with arrow keys

### Start the Application
